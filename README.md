## About the Letter

The letter includes an embedded image of a cross and crescent created using a
[cross-and-crescent package](https://github.com/lcamichigan/cross-and-crescent)
in LaTeX. To create this image,
[install](https://github.com/lcamichigan/cross-and-crescent#installing) the
cross-and-crescent package, and then enter in PowerShell or Terminal

```sh
latex -jobname logo -output-format pdf '\documentclass{standalone}\usepackage{cross-and-crescent}\begin{document}\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=36bp/8cm]\crossAndCrescentSetMacros\draw[line join=round,line width=1bp]\crossAndCrescentPath\end{tikzpicture}\end{document}'
```
